# COSI Data Challenge 2022

Welcome to the first COSI Data Challenge! This is the first of many COSI Data Challenges to be released on a yearly basis in preparation for the launch of the COSI Small Explorer mission ([Tomsick et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BAAS...51g..98T/abstract)) in 2027. The main goals of the COSI Data Challenges are to facilitate the development of the COSI data pipeline and analysis tools, and to provide resources to the astrophysics community to become familiar with COSI data. This first COSI Data Challenge was funded through NASA’s Astrophysics Research and Analysis (APRA) for the release of high-level analysis tools for the COSI Balloon instrument ([Kierans et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170105558K/abstract)), and thus the COSI Balloon model and flight data will be the focus this year. Future COSI Data Challenges will be released for the SMEX mission with increasingly more sophisticated tools and a larger range of astrophysical models and simulated sources each year. By the time we’re ready to fly COSI, we will have simulated all of the main science objectives, developed the tools required to analyze each case, and have educated a broader community to perform the analyses.

## Installation Instructions 

### Already have COSItools installed:
If you already have the COSItools installed on your computer, type `cosi` to navigate to the COSItools directory and activate the COSI python environment ("python-env"). Clone the cosi-data-challenge-1 repository.

The file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) lists all of the dependencies for running the data challenge, and they can all be installed using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

You will also need to add the [cosipy-classic](cosipy-classic) directory to your python path, e.g. `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/COSItools/cosi-data-challenge-1/cosipy-classic`. 

Some of the data products are large and we are using the Git Large File Server. You will need to install git-lfs: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage. After Git LFS has been successfully installed, navigate to your local cosi-data-challenge-1 directory and `git lfs pull` to download all of the data products. If this step is not performed, the file names will appear locally, but they will only be placeholders and the size will be only a few hundred kB. The total size of the data products should be 4.6 GB.

You should now be able to start a python session, or open one of the provided notebooks, and import the COSIpy_dc1 module, i.e. `from COSIpy_dc1 import *`, without issue. If you have any issues with the initialization, please see **Getting Help** below.

### New to COSItools:
Head to the feature/initialsetup branch of the cosi-setup Git repository and follow the readme guide: https://github.com/cositools/cosi-setup/tree/feature/initialsetup. Note that when making the installation you must include the option "--extras=cosi-data-challenge-1". This installation will include MEGAlib, ROOT, Geant4, Git LFS, and all packages in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. After successful installation (this will take time), you will want to activate the cosi python environment by typing `cosi`. 

You will also need to add the [cosipy-classic](cosipy-classic) directory to your python path, e.g. `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/COSItools/cosi-data-challenge-1/cosipy-classic`. 

## Getting Help

Since this is the first release of COSIpy, there will likely be issues. We hope to get feedback from the community on what worked well, what didn't, and how can we improve for next time. Please submit a New Issue in git if you have issues with the code. If you have general feedback, or need further assistance, please reach out to the COSI Data Challenge team lead: [Chris Karwin: christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov](mailto:christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov).


## Getting Started
The COSI pipeline tools, COSItools, are divided into two programs (see figure below): MEGAlib and COSIpy. MEGAlib (https://megalibtoolkit.com and https://github.com/zoglauer/megalib) is the Medium Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy Library, which is a general purpose tool that is state-of-the-art for MeV telescopes. MEGAlib performs the data calibration, event identification, reconstruction, as well as detailed source simulations. There are some high-level analysis tools in MEGAlib, but most of the COSI science analysis will be performed in COSIpy. COSIpy is the user-facing, python-based, high-level analysis tool for COSI data.

This Data Challenge will serve to introduce the community to COSIpy and general Compton telescope analysis. We have prepared Jupyter Notebooks to walk the user through the analyses which are provided under [spectral-fit](spectral-fit) and [imaging](imaging); however, we suggest reading through the below description before attempting the notebooks.

COSIpy was first developed by Thomas Siegert in 2019 to perform 511 keV image analysis from the 2016 COSI balloon flight ([Siegert et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897...45S/abstract)). Since then, it has been used for point source imaging and spectral extraction (e.g. [Zoglauer et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210213158Z/abstract)), Aluminum-26 (Al-26) spectral fitting ([Beechert et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..119B/abstract)) and Al-26 imaging, all using data from the COSI Balloon 2016 flight. These analyses and the current Data Challenge use what we refer to as “COSIpy-classic.” The team is currently working on improved response handling and streamlined tools built from the bottom up, and the new and improved COSIpy will be the focus of the coming years’ Data Challenges! With that in mind, there are still known issues and limitations with COSIpy-classic that we will call out throughout this work.

## The Simulated Data

For the first Data Challenge, we wanted to give the users a basic look at COSI data analysis, so we chose 3 straightforward examples based on the COSI science goals: </br>
1. Extracting the spectra from the Crab, Cen A, Cyg X-1, and Vela. </br>
2. Imaging bright point sources, such as the Crab and Cyg-X1. </br>
3. Imaging diffuse emission from 511 keV and the Al-26 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line. </br>

For each of these examples, we have provided a detailed description of the simulated sources and data products in the [data_products](data_products) directory. Each of the sources was simulated at 10x the astrophysical flux since the balloon flight had limited observation time, and because there were multiple detector failures during the balloon flight which reduced the effective area significantly. 

## General Compton Telescope Analysis Procedure

Analysis of MeV data is challenging due to high backgrounds and the complicated instrument responses of Compton telescopes like COSI. Thus, here we provide a basic description of Compton telescope data analysis as an introduction for new users before diving into the Data Challenge analysis. For those who are new to Compton telescopes, we encourage you to read the review: [Kierans, Takahashi & Kanbach 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220807819K/abstract). 

Compton telescopes perform single-photon detection, a technique whereby each photon is measured as a number of energy deposits in the detector volume (shown in blue in the figure below). The order of interactions must first be sequenced in time to reconstruct the scattering path and determine the original direction of the photon. This photon origin is constrained to a circle on the sky (a so-called Compton event circle) defined by an opening angle equal to the Compton scattering angle $(\phi)$ of the first interaction. A typical event in a Compton telescope is shown in the figure below: a photon Compton scatters twice in the detector volume and undergoes a photoelectric absorption as its third and final interaction. The position of each interaction is recorded and the incident energy of the photon is fully contained in the active detector volume. The event sequencing and reconstruction are performed in the MEGAlib tool; we will start our analysis with events that are already defined by their total energy deposit in the detector $(E_0)$, and the Compton scattering angle.

<img width="760" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 00 42 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080097-d3fdde9c-e7ae-494b-af02-1ffb846dbc33.png">

As shown in the figure above, a Compton telescope can image a source distribution by finding the overlap of event circles from multiple source photons. A point-source image can be recovered by performing deconvolution techniques. This List-mode imaging approach ([Zoglauer 2005](https://megalibtoolkit.com/documents/Zoglauer_PhD.pdf)) is implemented in MEGAlib and can be used for strong point sources, for example in laboratory measurements. However, this approach assumes a simplified detector response and cannot be used for the most sensitive analyses.

When performing analyses of astrophysical sources with high backgrounds, a more sophisticated description of the data space is required. This data space, along with the fundamentals of modern Compton telescope analysis techniques, was pioneered by the COMPTEL mission ([Schönfelder et al. 1993](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJS...86..657S/abstract) & [Diehl et al. 1992](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992NASCP3137...95D/abstract)) and is sometimes referred to as the COMPTEL Data Space, or simply the Compton Data Space (CDS). In the CDS, each event is defined by a minimum of 5 parameters. Three parameters describe the geometry of each event: the Compton scatter angle $(\phi)$ of the first interaction, and the polar and azimuthal angles of the scattered photon direction $(\chi, \psi)$. These angles as defined in instrument coordinates are shown in the figure below. The other two parameters in the CDS are the total photon energy $(E_0)$ and the event time $(t)$, but these are not always explicitly written. 

<img width="722" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 02 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080315-86545b58-7104-4ba1-b68d-e3a634e69fa5.png">

The scattering angles $(\phi, \chi, \psi)$ span the three orthogonal axes of the CDS. As photons from a point source at location $(\chi_0, \psi_0)$ scatter in the detector, the CDS is populated in the shape of a cone whose apex lies at the source location, as shown in the figure on the right. This is the point spread function of a Compton telescope. The opening angle of the CDS cone is 90º since the Compton scatter angle is equal (within measurement error) to the deviation of the scattered photon direction. An extended source will appear as a broadened cone. The more familiar Angular Resolution Measure (ARM) for Compton telescopes is a 1-dimensional projection of the width of the CDS cone walls, representing the angular resolution. 

All analyses with COSIpy start with reconstructed events defined in a photon list (MEGAlib’s .tra files). After reading in the data from the .tra file, the first step of any analysis is to bin the data into the CDS. For this Data Challenge, we are using 6º bin sizes for each of the scattering angles. This is because the angular resolution of the COSI Balloon instrument is ~6º at best, and smaller bins would be more computationally demanding. We are also using 10 energy bins for the continuum analyses, 2 hour time bins for the spectral analysis, and 30 minute time bins for the imaging analyses. For the narrow-line sources, such as 511 keV and Al-26, we use only 1 energy bin centered on the gamma-ray line of interest.

As a visual representation of the data (D) in the CDS, see the figure below. The three axes are the 3 scatter angles $(\phi, \chi, \psi)$. Each $(\phi, \chi, \psi)$ bin contains the number of events, or counts, with that geometry. These counts are illustrated with the red color fill (this is just a random distribution and not representative of what real data looks like in the CDS). The CDS is filled in this way for each energy and time bin, represented by the subscript $E,t$ in the figure. In COSIpy-classic, $\chi$ and $\psi$ are binned into in 1145 FISBEL bins. FISBEL stands for Fixed Integral Square Bins in Equi-Longitude, and is MEGAlib’s spherical axis binning that has approximately equal solid angle for each pixel.

<img width="400" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 03 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080461-6e97c2c2-4d36-4cfb-b13c-935f438616c1.png">

Now that we have a better understanding of the Compton telescope data space and have binned our data in the CDS, we’re ready to perform spectral analysis and imaging with COSI. There are 3 key pieces needed: 
1. Response Matrix
2. Sky Model
3. Background Model

We will describe these components here and explain how they are used for general fitting procedures with COSI data. When running through the analysis notebooks, pay attention to when these are initialized.

### Response Matrix

The response matrix (R) for Compton telescopes represents the probability that a photon with energy $E_0$ originating from Galactic coordinates $(l,b)$ interacts in the detector and is recorded as an event with measured energy E’ and scattering angles $(\phi,\chi,\psi)$. The probability distribution is normalized to match the total effective area of the instrument, defining the conversion from counts to physical parameters. The matrix that encodes this information is 2 dimensions larger $(l,b)$ than the CDS and describes the transformation between image space and the CDS, taking into account the accurate response of the instrument. We build the response matrix through extensive MEGAlib simulations: the instrument is situated at the center of an isotropically-emitting source and thus records photons from all surrounding source locations. With a sufficiently large number of incident photons, we can populate the entire CDS of possible scattering angles and thereby obtain a representation of each incident photon in the CDS.

<img width="965" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 05 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080645-6f1eecb9-a34a-489f-ae7c-79f43224ae32.png">

### Sky Model

For forward-folding analysis methods, we assume a source sky distribution, referred to as the sky (or signal) model (S). The sky model in image space can be, for example, a simple point source or a complicated diffuse model. The sky model also contains spectral and polarization assumptions about the source. This model is convolved with the instrument response matrix and knowledge of the instrument aspect pointing during observations to determine the representation of the sky model in the CDS. Below, we show this for a simple point source and regain the expected cone-shape in the CDS.

<img width="1065" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 06 10 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080720-dc1db3c5-0bee-4843-b8d5-ddb936745bb1.png">

### Background Model

We require an accurate estimate of the backgrounds during observations. This background model (B) can be achieved in a number of ways. One approach is to use the measured flight data from source-starved regions. Alternatively, one can perform full bottom-up simulations of the gamma-ray background at balloon-flight altitudes, including atmospheric contamination and instrumental activation. For this first Data Challenge, we use the latter approach. The simulation is further described in [data_products](data_products); in future Data Challenges, we will employ multiple background-model approaches.

With the background model generated from simulations, we subsequently bin it in the same CDS that we used for the data and the source model. We have already performed this step for you, and have provided a .npz file, which is a zipped numpy array of the background simulation in the CDS.

<img width="1053" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 06 45 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080812-bb591627-3127-454d-af92-1d859313774b.png">

### Fitting General Principle

Finally, we have all of our components and can perform the analysis. When model fitting, we can optionally free multiple spectral, polarization, and location parameters. For simplicity, in this Data Challenge we will only fit for the amplitudes of the source and background models ($\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively) that best describe the measured data: **D = $\alpha$ S + $\beta$ B**. This fit is shown schematically in the figure below and is performed for each energy bin and time bin independently. This procedure for spectral fitting and spatial model fitting is maximizing the likelihood in the CDS.

<img width="1074" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 07 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080880-83937b0d-15b0-4a93-b0dc-09368d3423ae.png">

If we don’t know what the source should look like, instead of providing a sky model we can remain agnostic to an assumed source distribution and perform image deconvolution. The data is represented as the sum of the response convolved with the source sky distribution (which we want to find) and the background:

<img width="482" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 08 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080950-0a042af0-0bd8-4360-9f7f-898edcd81ee1.png">

Since the response is non-invertible, we must use iterative deconvolutions to reveal the sky distribution. In COSIpy-classic, we introduce you to a modified Richardson-Lucy algorithm, which is a special case of the expectation maximization algorithm developed for COMPTEL’s images of diffuse gamma-ray emission ([Knödlseder et al. 1999](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999A%26A...345..813K/abstract)). The Richardson-Lucy algorithm starts from an initial isotropic (i.e. unbiased) image, and iteratively compares the data in the CDS to the sky distribution convolved with the transpose of the response matrix R:

<img width="257" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-16 at 11 08 28 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33991471/196080993-a258bd27-9df9-4996-924c-ec3bc7222aa8.png">

This will evolve into the maximum likelihood solution. There are other image deconvolution techniques that will be used for COSI imaging, and those will be introduced in subsequent Data Challenges.

In order to gain intuition for how to interpret this equation, consider that we are trying to find the number of photons in an image pixel given our model expectation $M = R \cdot S + B$. Here, $M$ are the model counts, calculated from a linear combination of the instrumental background $B$ and the sky morphology $S$, to which the image response function $R$ is applied to convert from image space to data space.<br>
In such a counting experiment, the measured data $D$ given the model expectation $M$ follows a Poisson distribution, so that the likelihood of measuring $D$ photons is given by $P(D|M) = \prod \frac{\exp(-M)M^D}{D!}$. The product here is taken over all sky pixels.<br>
Taking the logarithm of the likelihood and plugging in the model expectation results in $L \equiv \ln P(D|S,B) = \sum \left(-(R \cdot S + B) + D \ln(R \cdot B) \right)$.<br>
Assuming, for the moment, that the background is known, we can optimise the likelihood with respect to the wanted sky signal $S$, such that<br>
$0 = \nabla_S L = -I \cdot R^T + \frac{D \cdot R^T}{R \cdot S + B} = \left(1 - \frac{D}{R \cdot S + B} \right) \cdot R^T$.<br>
Finally, this equation can be solved iteratively, (for each pixel simultaneously) by assuming a starting sky distribution (map) for $S$, similar to Newton's method for example, which will result in the RL equation above.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a better understanding of the general approach to Compton telescope analyses, you’re ready to start on the analysis examples. First, we recommend you review the detailed descriptions of the simulations in the [data_products](data_products) directory. The easiest analysis is the spectral fitting, and we recommend you start there: [spectral_fit](spectral-fit). The Richardson-Lucy imaging is computationally intensive, and still largely hard-coded in this release, and thus we recommend you work through these notebooks second: [imaging](imaging). Please note that you should use a workstation with a large memory allocation for the imaging analyses, if one is available to you. A personal laptop with only 16 GB of memory, for example, will be limiting. Finally, we have also included some of the COSI Balloon data for analysis of the Crab Nebula as seen during the 2016 flight. After you’ve run through the spectral fitting and image deconvolution with the simulated data, you should be ready to analyze this real flight data: [balloon data](cosi_2016_balloon_data)! 

As mentioned previously, please don't hesitate to reach out to the COSI Data Challenge team if you have any questions, concerns, issues, or suggestions. Email [Chris Karwin](mailto:christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov).

## Bug Report

* COSIpy classic requires pystan version 2.19.1.1., which has compatibility issues with Ubuntu 22.04 and currently cannot be installed. This only impacts the imaging notebooks with the simulated data. They can still be ran without modification, and will produce qualitatively similar images for the point sources and 511; however, the Al26 notebook will not work without pytan. In order to install COSITools on Ubuntu 22.04 you must remove pystan from requirements.txt.  

* January 20, 2023: The Al-26 notebook was tested and executes in its current form on Ubuntu 20.04. We've heard reports that the image deconvolution fails at early iterations (~10) on Mac M1 (and does not run on Ubuntu 22.04; see pystan note above). This is under investigation. Note that the other imaging notebooks should still be working ok. Please attempt this notebook as you wish, try changing parameters in the algorithm, or refer to the 511 keV imaging notebook for another example of diffuse imaging.
