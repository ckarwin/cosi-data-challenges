## Introduction
The COSI data challenges are released on a yearly basis in preparation for the launch of the COSI SMEX mission. They are based on simulated data, which is intended to closely mimic the real flight data. Every year the data challenges have increasingly more realistic source and background models, and they are analyzed with increasingly complete and matured analysis tools. In general there are two main goals of the data challenges:

1. Facilitate development of the COSI data pipeline and analysis tools.
   - With routine feedback from scientists. 
   - Alongside development of the expected source models by the science team. 
2. Provide resources to the astrophysics community to become familiar with COSI data.
   - Excellent training for science team in preparation for first analyses after launch.
   - Public releases help with community building before COSI data is released.
