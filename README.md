## Introduction
The COSI data challenges are released on a yearly basis in preparation for the launch of the COSI SMEX mission. They are based on simulated data, which is intended to closely mimic the real flight data. Every year the data challenges have increasingly more realistic source and background models, and they are analyzed with increasingly complete and matured analysis tools. In general there are two main goals of the data challenges:

1. Facilitate development of the COSI data pipeline and analysis tools.
   - With routine feedback from scientists. 
   - Alongside development of the expected source models by the science team. 
2. Provide resources to the astrophysics community to become familiar with COSI data.
   - Excellent training for science team in preparation for first analyses after launch.
   - Public releases help with community building before COSI data is released. 

## Getting Started

## System Requirements
One of our goals in developing cosipy is to make it easily accesible to all users. **All of the data challenges starting with DC2 should be doable on a laptop with at least 16 GB of RAM**. We are still working on optimizing the code, and so please let us know if you are running into memory issues. 

## Getting Help
Please submit a new issue in the [cosipy](https://github.com/cositools/cosipy) git repository if you have issues with cosipy. If you have general feedback, or need further assistance, please reach out to the COSI Data Challenge team lead, Chris Karwin ([christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov](mailto:christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov)), the cosipy implementation lead, Israel Martinez-Castellanos ([israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov](israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov)), and the pipeline development lead Carolyn Kierans ([carolyn.a.kierans@nasa.gov](carolyn.a.kierans@nasa.gov)).

The simulations for the COSI data challenges are ran on high performance computing clusters. Most notably, we have made extensive use of NASA's [Discover cluster](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/systems/discover), the [MOGON](https://mogonwiki.zdv.uni-mainz.de/docs/introduction/what_is_mogon) cluster in Mainz, and Clemson University's [Palmetto](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/) cluster.
